# herdr-fingers

**tmux-fingers for [Herdr](https://herdr.dev), with previews.** Press a
key, every path and URL on screen gets a one- or two-letter hint. Type the
hint, and a menu asks what to do with it: **preview** it or **copy** it.
Preview shows an image in the terminal, pages a text file, lists a
directory, or opens a URL in the browser. Hold Shift to type the match into
the pane instead, Ctrl to open it. No mouse, no selection dragging, no
scrolling back to find the thing.

> This is a fork of
> [nathan-poncet/herdr-fingers](https://github.com/nathan-poncet/herdr-fingers).
> It adds the preview menu, the image viewer of
> [herdr-image-hints](https://github.com/pglira/herdr-image-hints), and
> hints on every pane of a split tab.

*Copy a path, paste another with Shift, multi-select two commits with Tab, label URLs. [Watch it as a video.](https://github.com/nathan-poncet/herdr-fingers/raw/main/assets/demo.mp4)*

A port of [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers) to
Herdr, written in Rust from the ground up: same patterns, same keyboard
layouts, same actions and multi-select, running as a native Herdr plugin.

## Install

```sh
herdr plugin install pglira/herdr-fingers
```

Herdr clones the repository and builds it (a Rust toolchain is required:
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)). Then bind a key in
`~/.config/herdr/config.toml`:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+f"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "nathan-poncet.herdr-fingers.start"
description = "copy with hints"
```

Reload and try it:

```sh
herdr server reload-config
```

Press `prefix+f` (`ctrl+b` then `f` by default) in any pane.

## Use

Hints appear over every match. The shortest hints sit at the bottom of the
screen, where the freshest output is; identical texts share one hint.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| hint (`a`, `sd`…) | open the menu for the match: `p` preview, `c` copy |
| `Shift` + hint | type the match into the pane |
| `Ctrl` + hint | open the match: URLs in the browser, files in their app |
| `Alt` + hint | custom action (none by default) |
| `Tab` | toggle multi-select: pick several hints, then `Tab` or `Enter` |
| `Backspace` | erase the last typed key |
| `?` | help |
| `Esc`, `q`, `Ctrl+C` | close |

Typing the first key of a two-key hint hides every other hint. A URL or path
the terminal wrapped over two rows is one hint, and copies without the line
break. The overlay redraws the pane exactly where it is — with its own
colors — even when the tab is split.

In the menu, `p` or `c` choose directly; `j`/`k` (or the arrows) and
`Enter` work too, and `Esc` or `q` close it. A multi-selection offers only
the copy.

## Preview

Preview decides by what the match is:

| Match | Preview |
|---|---|
| URL (`http(s)://`, `ftp://`, `file://`) | opens with `xdg-open` (`open` on macOS) |
| image file | an image popup, drawn with the Kitty graphics protocol |
| text file | a pager popup: `bat` (or `batcat`) when installed, else `less`, else `more` |
| directory | `ls -la` in the same pager |
| binary file, missing path | a Herdr notification |

A relative path is taken from the pane's working directory; `~/` is your
home directory. Both popups close with `q`.

The image popup works wherever Herdr runs in a terminal with Kitty
graphics (Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm), also in a dev container or over SSH.
In it, `n`/`N` step to the next or previous image of the directory, `y`
copies the absolute path (OSC 52), and `q` or `Esc` closes it.
Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF (first frame), WebP, BMP, TIFF, ICO, QOI,
TGA, PNM and Radiance HDR.

### From other programs

`herdr-fingers open <path-or-url>` shows the same preview from any program
that runs in a Herdr pane. The binary is at `target/release/herdr-fingers`
in the plugin directory:

```sh
root="$(herdr plugin list --plugin nathan-poncet.herdr-fingers --json | jq -r '.result.plugins[0].plugin_root')"
ln -s "$root/target/release/herdr-fingers" ~/.local/bin/herdr-fingers
```

For example, a [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io) key that previews the
hovered file (`keymap.toml`):

```toml
[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]
on   = "<C-y>"
run  = "shell 'herdr-fingers open %h'"
desc = "Preview in a herdr popup"
```

## What gets a hint

The tmux-fingers built-ins, ported one for one, plus `image`. Only the
patterns for paths and URLs are on by default: `url`, `path`, `image`,
`git-status` and `diff`. Turn on others with `enabled_builtin_patterns`.

| Name | Matches |
|---|---|
| `ip` | IPv4 addresses |
| `uuid` | UUIDs |
| `sha` | Git SHAs (7 to 128 hex digits) |
| `digit` | numbers of four digits or more |
| `url` | `http(s)://`, `git@`, `git://`, `ssh://`, `ftp://`, `file:///` |
| `path` | anything with a `/` in it: `src/main.rs`, `~/.config`, `/etc/hosts` |
| `image` | image files, also without a `/`: `plot.png`, `out/fig.JPG` |
| `hex` | `0x…` numbers |
| `kubernetes` | Kubernetes resource names (`configmap/…`, `deployment.apps/…`) |
| `kubernetes-pod` | deployment-managed pod names (`nginx-66b6c48dd5-7xb2r`) |
| `git-status` | the path on a `modified:` / `new file:` / `deleted:` line |
| `git-status-branch` | the remote branch in `Your branch is up to date with '…'` |
| `diff` | the path in a `--- a/…` / `+++ b/…` header |

When two patterns start at the same column the earlier one in this table
wins; custom patterns come before all of them.

## Configure

The plugin writes a fully commented `config.toml` on first run. Find it with:

```sh
herdr plugin config-dir nathan-poncet.herdr-fingers
```

Every key is optional — [`examples/config.toml`](examples/config.toml) lists
them all with their defaults. The ones people change:

```toml
keyboard_layout = "azerty"          # or qwerty-homerow, dvorak, colemak, …
# alphabet = "asdfghjkl"            # your own keys instead of a layout
hint_position = "left"              # or "right"

main_action = ":menu:"              # plain hint; ":copy:" skips the menu
shift_action = ":paste:"            # Shift + hint
ctrl_action = ":open:"              # Ctrl + hint
alt_action = ""                     # Alt + hint; e.g. "xargs nvim" or a script

enabled_builtin_patterns = ["url", "path", "image", "sha"]

popup_width = "85%"                 # preview popups: cells or a percentage
popup_height = "85%"

[[patterns]]
name = "ticket"
regex = "PROJ-[0-9]+"

[[patterns]]
name = "env"
regex = "env=(?P<match>[a-z0-9_-]+)"   # only the group is copied

[style]
hint = { fg = "black", bg = "yellow", bold = true }
highlight = { fg = "yellow" }
backdrop = { dim = true }           # dim everything that is not a match
```

### Actions

`:menu:`, `:copy:`, `:paste:` and `:open:` are built in; `""` does nothing. Anything
else is a command line, run from the pane's working directory with the
picked text on its **stdin** and two environment variables, exactly like
tmux-fingers: `MODIFIER` (`main`, `shift`, `ctrl` or `alt`) and `HINT`.

```toml
alt_action = "sh -c 'open \"https://github.com/search?q=$(cat)\"'"
```

In multi-select mode the texts are joined with `multi_separator` (a space
by default) and handed to the action of the last modifier used.

### Clipboard

By default `:copy:` sends the text as an **OSC 52** sequence. Herdr forwards
it to the terminal you are attached from, so it lands on *your* clipboard
even when the Herdr server runs on another machine over SSH. Most terminals
accept it out of the box (Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, iTerm2, Alacritty, foot,
Windows Terminal); tmux and some others need it enabled. Set
`clipboard = "system"` to use `pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip` or `xsel` on the
machine running Herdr instead, or `"both"`.

Herdr can show a toast when a pane sets the clipboard
(`[ui.toast.clipboard]` in Herdr's config); `show_copied_notification = true`
adds a toast with the copied text through Herdr's notification system.

### Layouts

`keyboard_layout` takes the tmux-fingers layouts — `qwerty`, `azerty`,
`qwertz`, `dvorak`, `colemak`, each with `-homerow`, `-left-hand` and
`-right-hand` variants. The keys `c`, `i`, `m`, `n` and `q` are never used
for hints, so they cannot collide with the overlay's controls.

## Differences from tmux-fingers

- **No jump mode.** tmux-fingers can move the copy-mode cursor onto a match;
  Herdr's API does not expose that. Everything else maps: main/shift/ctrl/alt
  actions, `:copy:`/`:paste:`/`:open:`, multi-select, custom patterns, layouts.
- **Rust regex syntax** for custom patterns (no look-around, no
  back-references); named groups are `(?P<match>…)` or `(?<match>…)`.
- **Colors are kept.** The overlay redraws the pane with its own styling.

## Troubleshooting

```sh
herdr plugin list                                            # is it there and enabled?
herdr plugin action list --plugin nathan-poncet.herdr-fingers
herdr plugin log list --plugin nathan-poncet.herdr-fingers   # what Herdr saw when it ran the action
tail "$(herdr plugin config-dir nathan-poncet.herdr-fingers | sed 's#/config/#/state/#')/herdr-fingers.log"
```

Nothing happens on the key? Check the action id in your `[[keys.command]]`
block and run `herdr server reload-config`. The overlay opens but shows
"Nothing to pick"? Try the pattern engine on a dump of the pane:

```sh
herdr pane read <pane-id> --source visible --format ansi > dump.txt
herdr-fingers scan --width <pane width> < dump.txt      # hint, row:col, text
```

`herdr-fingers` is `target/release/herdr-fingers` inside the directory
`herdr plugin list` prints as the plugin root.

## Requirements

- Herdr 0.7 or newer, on Linux or macOS
- A Rust toolchain (1.85+) to build — `herdr plugin install` runs `cargo build --release`

## Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pglira/herdr-fingers.git
cd herdr-fingers
cargo build --release
herdr plugin link "$PWD"
```

`cargo test` runs the suite: the ANSI parser, wrapped-row joining, every
built-in pattern, hint generation, the picking state machine, the two use
cases against in-memory fakes, the config loader, the Herdr client against
a fake socket, and the renderer on a ratatui test backend. `cargo fmt --check` and
`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` must be clean; CI runs all of it
on Linux and macOS.

The code follows Clean Architecture in one crate: a pure kernel under
`src/domain/`, use cases under `src/usecases/` that only see ports, and
adapters implementing those ports for Herdr, the terminal, the clipboard
and processes. A test enforces the Dependency Rule. See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
